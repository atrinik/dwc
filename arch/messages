... and then did the Alchemist agree to make me my potion.
First he called to his grim servants who hauled forth a 
great iron cauldron. Into this black device did he deposit

... that deep in the Underground City lives a demonic skeletal dragon,
whom few have seen, and even fewer survived the battle to tell the tale.
Those skillful adventurers that survived the fight brought home glorious
treasures, including the dragon's own bones, which make some kind of armour.

It is rumored that the demonic skeletal dragon has been brought to this
world from another dimension by the drow annihilator, who attempted to
summon a great warrior but failed, summoning the demonic skeletal dragon
instead, who would kill anyone who dared approach him. This is why he is
sealed inside a room in Underground City and orcs who live there tremble
at the thought of seeing the dragon.
