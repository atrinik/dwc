Humans are the generalists of the races.
They are fit for any trade, and usually pick up a skill from
their parents in addition to what they've learned as apprentices
in their craft. Females have the same stats as males.

The name half-elf can be confusing because it is used for humans
with elvish blood in the 2nd or 3rd generation. Real half bloods
are normally counted as elves. Half-elves are very similar to
humans but a bit more focused on power and dexterity.

Some dwarves have joined the human fight against Moroch and their
skills were very valuable. Some have traveled to the human realms
but there are also rumors from hidden dwarf cities in the deeps.
The dwarves themselves don't talk much about it...

The race of Thelra is a powerful and fierce race from the cold North.
They decided to help fight alongside the chronomancers of Thraal
in the war against Moroch. They excel as wizards, but can take on
most other skills quite well.
