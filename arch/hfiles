The /apply command is used to apply selected things. For example, you can wield a sword in your inventory, or wear an armour. You can also apply things like stairs to enter them, or handles to activate gates.

/apply accepts two flags, -a and -u.

This would always apply the item 'amulet' from your inventory, never unapplying it:
/apply -a amulet

==========
Name: object_id
Title: Object ID
DM: 1
Autocomplete: 0
When a help page mentions ~object_id~ in syntax parameters, it means you have to specify object name (often without spaces) or its ID (which can be found by using examine on the object, near the top saying 'count xxxxx': the xxxxx is the ID).

If you use the object's ID, you have to put a hash symbol in front of it, for example:

/patch #86301 no_pick 1

It's easier to use the object's name, but many objects have spaces in the names, and many commands (like /patch above) don't allow you to include spaces in the object's name:

/patch guard friendly 0
/remove skeleton mage

The IDs/names will first be checked against the online players (not in their inventories though), then below you (including inventories), and at last on the whole map the DM is standing on (including inventories).
