# types.xml - This is the defintitions-file for all the different    #
# Atrinik object types and their attributes.                         #
#                                                                    #
# The server code of the Atrinik game is always changing and         #
# evlolving. From time to time, object-attributes change in purpose, #
# or new ones are created.                                           #
# Therefore, it is important that an Editor is flexible and          #
# easy to "upgrade" to handle such new features. That's why the      #
# AtrinikEditor reads the type-definitions from this xml file.       #
#                                                                    #
# If you encounter bugs, typos or missing entrys in the LATEST       #
# VERSION of this file - Don't hesitate to improve it, contact us    #
# and eventually send the improved file to us: <admin@atrinik.org>.  #
# We will put it into the "official version" of the AtrinikEditor    #
# and all fellow Atrinik-Map-Makers can benefit from your work!      #

<!-- The attributes of the default_type get added to all other types by
	 default. Every type can have an 'ignore' element however, which is
	 used to specify default attributes *not* to inherit. -->
<default_type>
	<attribute arch="name" editor="name" type="string">
		This is the name of the object, displayed to the player.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="title" editor="title" type="string">
		This is the object's title. Once an object is identified the
		title is attached to the name. Typical titles are "of Yordan",
		"of xray vision" etc.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="sub_type" editor="sub type" type="int">
		This important value is used to define "sub types" for objects of
		the same object type. Examples are weapons, which are all from
		type WEAPON but can be different sub types like slash, cleave,
		two-handed, polearms and so on. This value goes to the client
		too.

		Warning: Not all objects have a sub type and changing it without
		care can corrupt server AND/OR the clients. Normally this is not
		a subject to change outside arch definition.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="layer" editor="layer" type="int">
		This is the map layer the object will put in. The selected layer
		will affect where and how this object is shown on client side.
		Layer 0 is reserved for sys_object type objects and will NEVER be
		shown on client side. Layer 1 is for floor objects and layer 2
		for floor masks. Layer 3 and 4 are for items on the ground. Layer
		5 is for walls, layer 6 is reserved for players and layer 7 is
		for spell effects and high flying/visible objects like arrows.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="face" editor="image" type="facename">
		The image name defines what image is displayed for this object
		in-game.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="animation" editor="animation" type="animname">
		The animation-name defines what animation is displayed for this
		object in-game. Note that a set animation will overrule the face.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="anim_speed" editor="anim speed" type="int">
		How fast to play this animation.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_animated" editor="is animated" type="bool">
		If set, the object is animated and animation is used.

		Note: Some special objects will use an animation NOT as animation
		but as frame list. Examples are buttons (which frames are changed
		by the object status of the button). IS_TURNABLE will enable
		direction turning for some object types. These flags are all
		system related. Be VERY careful when changing them.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="speed_left" editor="start speed" type="float">
		When an active object (with 'speed' being non-zero) is put on a
		map, this value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if
		negative, value is turned positive before) is added to this
		value - if it is bigger than 0 the object 'will do something' and
		this counter is decreased with -1.0.

		By default a normal object will be put on the map with start
		speed 0. It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
		Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
		'lifetime' round until it does something.

		A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it
		should try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game.
		A bomb for example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it
		will stay then on map until the bomb becomes active - it
		explodes.

		The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0
		will give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100
		ticks.

		Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a
		random value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a
		start speed of -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed
		between -1.0 and -0.1. This is useful to let a row of same
		objects act in different tick ranges.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="nrof" editor="number" type="int">
		This value determines the number of objects in one stack (for
		example: 100 goldcoins =&gt; "number = 100"). You should set this
		at least to one, for any pickable object - otherwise it won't be
		mergeable into a stack.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="weight" editor="weight" type="int">
		This value defines the object's weight in gram (1000g is 1kg).
		Objects with zero weight are not pickable for players. Still, set
		the "non-pickable" flag for explicitly non-pickable objects.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="value" editor="value" type="int">
		Change an object's value.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="glow_radius" editor="glow radius" type="int">
		If &lt;glow radius&gt; is set to a value greater than zero, the
		object appears lit up on dark maps. &lt;glow radius&gt; can be a
		value between 0 and 4, the higher, the more light does the object
		emit.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="material_real" editor="material" type="list_material_real">
		The material defines the exact material of which the object
		consists. It is much more specific than &lt;material class&gt;,
		however only one material can be selected, not multiple.

		&lt;material&gt; is not required to be set, it can be left
		'undefined'.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="material" editor="material class" type="bitmask_material">
		This bitmask-value informs the player of which basic material(s)
		the object consists. Material class does also affect how likely
		the object can be destroyed by hazardous spell-effects, like
		firestorm.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="can_stack" editor="stackable" type="bool">
		If set, the item can be stacked. Careful, don't use on rings or
		other applyable items, it will lead to side effects.

		Missiles are designed to be used as stacks for example.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_pick" editor="non-pickable" type="bool">
		If set, the object cannot be picked up (neither by players nor
		monsters).
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="player_only" editor="player only" type="bool">
		If set, only players can enter the tile the object with this flag
		is on.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_invisible" editor="invisible" type="bool">
		Generally makes the object invisible. Invisible objects will be
		shown if the player has "see invisible" (from an item). To hide
		objects totally from detection, use "sys_object".
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="sys_object" editor="inv. system object" type="bool">
		Marks an object as system object. System objects are ALWAYS
		invisible and hidden from the players.

		System objects are put in layer 0.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_teleport" editor="no teleport" type="bool">
		Marks an object as no teleport object. A no teleport object can't
		be teleported by teleporter except if the object is inside the
		inventory of another object which can be teleported.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="blocksview" editor="block view" type="bool">
		If an item is set to block view, players (and monsters) cannot
		see beyond it unless they cross it or manage to stand on top of
		it.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="one_drop" editor="one drop" type="bool">
		If this flag is set for an item inside monster's quest_container
		with the quest being quest item type, the player will only be able
		to get this item once.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="identified" editor="identified" type="bool">
		If an item is identified, the player has full knowledge about it.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="reflect_spell" editor="reflect spells" type="bool">
		Object will reflect spells.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="reflect_missile" editor="reflect missiles" type="bool">
		Object will reflect missiles.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_magical" editor="magical" type="bool">
		If set, this object counts as "magical". Detect magic or identify
		will show this flag and the player will see a small blue M in the
		client's inventory part.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="cursed" editor="cursed" type="bool">
		The item is cursed. This object can't be removed when wielded or
		worn (without uncursing it). Remove curse will remove this flag.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="cursed_perm" editor="permanent cursed" type="bool">
		The item is permanently cursed. If this flag is set, applying or
		unapplying it will set "cursed 1" again. This flag can't be
		removed by remove curse.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="damned" editor="damned" type="bool">
		Stronger form of curse. Item can't be removed when wielded or
		worn. Remove damnation will remove this flag.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="damned_perm" editor="permanent damned" type="bool">
		The item is permanently damned. If this flag is set, applying or
		unapplying it will set "damned 1" again. This flag can't be
		removed by remove damnation.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_magic" editor="no spells" type="bool">
		If enabled, it is impossible for players to use spells on that
		spot.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="no_cleric" editor="no prayers" type="bool">
		If enabled, it is impossible for players to use prayers on that
		spot.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="unpaid" editor="unpaid" type="bool">
		An &lt;unpaid&gt; item cannot be used unless the player carried
		it over a shop mat, paying the demanded price. Setting this flag
		makes sense only for items inside shops.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="is_turnable" editor="is turnable" type="bool">
		System flag. Object can be turned into directions.
	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="direction" editor="direction" type="int">
		The object's direction.
	</attribute>

	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="can_roll" editor="moveable" type="bool">
		If set, the object is able to "roll", so it can be pushed around
		with the /push command. This setting is used for boulders and
		barrels. If you're setting this attribute, make sure to check
		"can move on" as well, in order to set relevant terrain types
		the object can be pushed to.

		Useful for puzzles and mazes.

	</description>
	<attribute arch="last_sp" editor="glow radius" type="int">
		If &lt;glow radius&gt; is set to a value not zero, the object
		appears lit up on dark maps. The higher the value, the more light
		does the object emit. The current reasonable max value is 9.

		If the value is 0, the light can't be lit and can't be applied.
		This is used for burned out lights like torches.

		If the value is negative, this object will invoke darkness.

	<attribute arch="glow_radius" editor="light on" type="int">
		Applyable light can be turned on or off. The value above will
		determinate how and then it's copied to this value. If this

	</attribute>
	<attribute arch="maxhp" editor="max. ticks of light" type="int">
		&lt;Max. Ticks of Light&gt; defines the maximal value of

		Abilities are to be put in a monster's inventory. They grant
		monsters the knowledge to cast spells. Spells from abilities are
		usually magical in nature, thus adding magic to the spell damage
		they produce. If not marked as magical, the ability as natural
		effect can't be disenchanted or blocked by dispel magic.
		<br><br>
		A particularly nice feature of abilities is that they can hold
		two spells: One for short range and one for long range use.

		If you want to create "customized" spell casting monsters, you
		should use abilities (rather than spell books/wands or
		something). The long/short-range spell feature can make boss
		monsters more interesting and challenging.
		<br><br>
		You should keep in mind that magic abilities allow players to get
		better resistance. You can turn off the magic part to make the
		spells more dangerous. However, this really should not be
		necessary unless you work on very high level maps.
		<br><br>
		It is possible to create monsters that will heal other friends.
		To accomplish this, simply go to the monster's <b>Behave</b> tab,
		<b>behavior</b> select box and check <b>Find friends for friendly
		spells</b>. Then create an ability in the monster with <b>short range
		spell</b> set as minor (or greater) healing. If you want this monster
		to also heal itself when it takes damage and has a valid enemy, set
		<b>long range spell</b> to the same spell.

		Spellcasting walls pose an interesting alternative to monsters.
		Usually they are set to be undestroyable ("alive 0"). Thus, while
		monsters in a map can be cleared out, the magic walls remain. Low
		level characters for example will not be able to pass through
		their spell-area, hence they cannot loot a map that a high level
		character might have cleared out.
		<br><br>
		Another point of magic walls is that if the player dies, he has
		to face them all again. Magic walls can add a kind of "permanent
		thrill" to your maps.

		Quest containers are containers to be inserted to monsters and can be used in
		different ways depending on type of the quest.

		<h2>One drop quest</h2>
		One drop quest is a quest which doesn't have a quest giver, but is only located
		inside a monster. This is used to create quest items that will only drop once for
		each player, like King Rhun's Cloak. Item to be dropped for the player is inserted
		inside the quest container. If the item has "one_drop 1" set, the player will never
		be able to find the item again a second time. This means it should be set for special
		drops like Rhun's Cloak, but not for keys.

		<h2>Kill quest</h2>
		This kind of quest requires the player to kill X monsters before the quest is
		completed. Nothing is inserted inside the quest container.

		<h2>Kill item quest</h2>
		This is similar to a one drop quest, but the quest has a quest giver, which requires
		the player to find the item that is being looked for. Typically, a monster will drop
		the object to be found. The object that is being looked for is inserted inside the
		quest container.
	]]>
	</description>
	<use>
	<![CDATA[
		A useful trick with quest containers is that you can put the containers into the
		inventory of a random creator. Since random creators are parsed when the monster
		spawns and not when the inventory drops, this is useful to create a quest where
		the player needs to kill 5 ghosts, but the ghosts have only 50% chance to get
		counted to the killed total, with the help of random creators. Another example
		is a quest where an item is being looked for that drops from a specific monster
		(or a bunch of monsters) but using random creators it has only 10% chance of
		being dropped.

		Beacons are objects which can be located by scripts using their
		ID, wherever in the game they might be. This behavior is useful,
		for example, for gates and switches on different maps, as
		connections normally work only on a single map (you can't open a
		gate that is on map2 with lever that is on map1, for example).
		<br><br>
		With beacons, however, you can. Make a lever that triggers a
		script on use, with the script looking for a specific beacon ID
		in the game (if you know the map path the beacon is on you should
		use ReadyMap() first to ensure the beacon's map is loaded in
		memory). The beacon would be inside an invisible lever on the map
		with the gate you want to trigger sharing the same connection
		values, and the script would just then trigger the invisible
		lever using something like:
		<br><br>
		me.Apply(beacon.environment, APPLY_TOGGLE)
