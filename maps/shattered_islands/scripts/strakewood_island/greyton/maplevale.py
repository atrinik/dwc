		me.SayTo(activator, "\nOh certainly! Vashla was the Goddess of Vanity. What do you expect? It was very difficult to satisfy her appetite for praise. That was one of the reasons the elves of Eromir refused to worship her. I know it because I once saw the book of liturgy.\n\nOh I shouldn't make fun of a goddess. Anyway, the point is, deities do not change and Vashla wouldn't have allowed her followers to worship her like you do. As I observe, you humans do not even have any other ritual than touching the altar, while fully enjoying his ^gifts^.")

	elif msg == "gifts":
		me.SayTo(activator, "\nResurrections, of course! A great and powerful god he must be.\n\nHmmm... it leads me to wonder. If the god of Tabernacle is not Vashla, who is he then? What is his purpose and why is he helping you? Maybe human gods are different from Elven gods? Oh don't worry, I was merely thinking out loud.")
