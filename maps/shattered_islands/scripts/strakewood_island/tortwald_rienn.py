## @file
## This script handles the Underground City level 2 side quest.
## Player needs to talk to captured guard, Tortwald, in UC level 2 and
## deliver a letter to the guard's wife, Rienn, in Fort Ghzal. Rienn then
## gives the player another letter that they have to deliver to Tortwald.
## Tortwald then rewards the player with a key.
