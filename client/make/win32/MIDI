For MIDI support on Windows, you will need to download GUS patches from
here:

http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz

and untar the archive to the client directory. Also the timidity.cfg file
in the directory with this README file needs to be copied to the client
directory.
