# item_power_factor is the relation of how the players equipped item_power
# total relates to their overall level. If 1.0, then sum of the character's
# equipped item's item_power can not be greater than their overall level.
# If 2.0, then that sum can not exceed twice the character's overall level.
# By setting this to a high enough value, you can effectively disable
# the item_power code.
