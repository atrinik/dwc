 * Use balanced stat loss code?
 * This code is a little more merciful with repeated stat loss at lower
 * levels. Basically, the more stats you have lost, the less likely that
 * you will lose more. Additionally, lower level characters are shown
 * a lot more mercy (there are caps on how much of a stat you can lose too).
 * On the nasty side, if you are higher level, you can lose mutiple stats
 * _at_once_ and are shown less mercy when you die. But when you're higher
 * level, it is much easier to buy back your stats with potions.
 * Turn this on if you want death-based stat loss to be more merciful
 * at low levels and more cruel at high levels.
 * Only works when stats are depleted rather than lost. This option has
 * no effect if you are using genuine stat loss.
 *
 * The BALSL_.. values control this behaviour.
 * BALSL_NUMBER_LOSSES_RATIO determines the number of stats to lose.
 * the character level is divided by that value, and that is how many
 * stats are lost.
 *
 * BALSL_MAX_LOSS_RATIO puts the upper limit on depletion of a stat -
 * basically, level/max_loss_ratio is the most a stat can be depleted.
 *
 * BALSL_LOSS_CHANCE_RATIO controls how likely it is a stat is depleted.
 * The chance not to lose a stat is
 * depleteness^2 / (depletedness^2+ level/ratio).
 * ie, if the stats current depleted value is 2 and the character is level
 * 15, the chance not to lose the stat is 4/(4+3) or 4/7.  The higher the
 * level, the more likely it is a stat can get really depleted, but
